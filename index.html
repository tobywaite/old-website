                  <p class='lead'>I'm on an airplane leaving Ohio, flying to California, not looking back. After four and a half formative years, I'm moving on. This is the first time I've truly left anywhere, and I'm still coming to terms with that. Before, any time I went somewhere (be it for college, internships, vacation) it was always temporary, I would be back. This time is different, though. Cleveland is now firmly a figment of my past, I have no plans to go back, and hardly even have intentions to try to maintain my connection to it (at least to the location).
